  ## Description

  In this project, we were introduced to MySQL, which is type of database system. MySQL utilizes Structured Query Language (SQL) to performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. We can create different tables to store and manage many types of data.  

  Using MySQL, we have to create an Employee Management System (EMS). Inquirer will allow users to enter, access and edit data on employees, departments and roles.

  ## Installation

  This application requires the user to have Node.js downloaded onto their system. It is recommended that the user downloads v16 up to v18 for this application to run properly. 

  MySQL is also required for this app to run properly. Follow this step-by-step [guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mysql/mysql-installation-guide) to make sure everything is downloaded smoothly.

  After opening up this app, make sure to type these into the integrated terminal and install these required npm packages: 
  - `npm i inquirer` prompts the user with questions to interact with the database.
  - `npm i mysql2` connects users to the MySQL database.
  - `npm i figlet` renders the ascii art in the beginning of the app.
  - `npm i table` renders the data requested by the user into a table.


  ## Usage

  As shown in the video below, after typing `node.index` into the terminal, the application will start and prompt the user with a menu of different options. Go through these different options to view, add, edit and delete data from the employee tracker database.
